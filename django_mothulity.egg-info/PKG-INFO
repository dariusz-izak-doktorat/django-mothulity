Description: # mothulity - web interface
        
        Web Interface and database/job scheduler for [mothulity](https://github.com/dizak/mothulity).
        
        The main principle is to:
        1. Present HTML front-end to the user which gathers submission data.
        2. Run a separate sched.py script which takes care of reading what was gathered in the database, submits it to [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) and watches the submitted process.
        
        ### Installation
        
        1. Create virtual env with:  ``` conda env create --file /path/to/mothulity.yaml ```
        
        2. Type ```django-admin startproject <name_of_project>```.
        
        3. Add ```mothulity.apps.MothulityConfig``` to <name_of_project>/<name_of_project>/settings.py.
        
        4. Add  ```MEDIA_URL = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "mothulity/upload/")``` and ```HEADNODE_PREFIX_URL = "/path/to/files/on/computing_cluster"```.
        
          - MEDIA_URL is where uploaded files are stored on the web-server.
        
          - HEADNODE_PREFIX_URL is where files are copied to the computing cluster.
        
          **EACH URL MUST HAVE TRAILING SLASH!**
        
        5. Add ```from django.conf.urls import include``` to <name_of_project>/<name_of_project>/urls.py.
        
        6. Add ```url(r"^mothulity/", include("mothulity.urls"))``` to <name_of_project>/<name_of_project>/urls.py.
        
        7. ```git clone https://github.com/dizak/mothulity_django``` to <name_of_project> and rename it to ```mothulity```
        
        9. Replace ```sys.path.append("/home/dizak/Software/django_site/")``` with ```sys.path.append("/home/dizak/Software/<name_of_project>/")```
        
        10. Replace ```os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "django_site.settings")```
        with ```os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "<name_of_project>.settings")```
        
        8. Run ```python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate```.
        
        9. Run ```tests python manage.py test mothulity```.
        
        10. Run ```python manage.py runserver```.
        
        ### Requirements
        
        SSH keys exchanged with the computing cluster.
